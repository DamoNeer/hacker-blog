### [](#header-3)Solution

The Youtube video introduces something called the "magic eye". After a google search of "magic eye + steganography", I came across this [link](https://magiceye.ecksdee.co.uk/)

Simply upload the given image there and the flag will be revealed! (You can also adjust the quality a bit by dragging the square button left and right)
