This is the first challenge that I have gotten first blood in. This challenge would have been impossible for those who have never heard of "Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit" or have
never tried to google "ink + steganography".![chrome_muBCiUWXe3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81070073/115099858-87efa780-9eed-11eb-9c5e-53bd7e2585bd.png)

I just put the image under decode tab and I have made sure to create a blank text file for the output message. Also, no password was needed!
