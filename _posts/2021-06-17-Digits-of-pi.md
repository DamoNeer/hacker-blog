### [](#header-3)Solution

I have noticed that there is a hidden sheet in the spreadsheet. In order to see it, I need to be able to guess a correct string that will be in that hidden sheet.

Click "Edit" > "Find & Replace" > Guess a word that will be on the hidden sheet > Click "Find" until you see the contents in the hidden sheet.
